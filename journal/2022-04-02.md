- Signed up for a [[2022-spring-reading-challenge|spring reading challenge]], to read 10 books in 10 weeks. Will use this opportunity to go deep on [[Ernest Hemingway]]. I've only read two of his books before, [[The Snows of Kilimanjaro]] and [[The Old Man and the Sea]]. The ten weeks starts on Monday, so better get ready.
