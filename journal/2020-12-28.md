- Finished [[The End of Everything]] by Katie Mack. I liked it, [[vacuum decay]] is definiely my favorite way for the universe to end.
- Started listening to [[4-3-2-1]] by [[Paul Auster]]. I tried listening to this book a while back, and it's really really good, but it's also almost 37 hours long. This time I'll surely make it!
